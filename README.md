## Lab 27 - Reddit Search Engine

I am using React to build an application that will allow search functionality for reddit to return results from a specific subreddit.

###Note
At this time, this app is not functional and will need to be retooled to work. 

To use:

- Fork and clone this repo
- Run `npm i`
- Type `npm run watch` into the console to generate page in browser
- Enter search critera into fields to return results from reddit.
